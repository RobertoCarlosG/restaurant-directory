Problem 2 - Programming: In this problem, you are asked to develop a web application using 
Python and Microsoft SQL Server. The software architecture is the following:
Database (SQL Server) <=> RestFUL API <=> Front-end (HTML/Javscript/CSS)
For the front-end. you can use any JavaScript framework (e.g., AngularJS, Vue, React). For the
